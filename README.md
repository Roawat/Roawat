- 👋 Hi, I’m @Roawat
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded Software Engineering.  I love to twiddle the bits and make the chips dance.  I also have a passion for optimization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Google Apps Script (GAS, Javascript-based).  The next step is to blend HTML with GAS to create custom interfaces for Google Sheets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting my device library into the Arduino repository for all to use.
- 📫 How to reach me: RossAkeakamaiWatkins@gmail.com.
